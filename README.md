# Rock_Paper_Scissors CSharp
This is a rock paper scissors game you play it in the terminal with c#.

## What does it do?

Basically the program runs in the terminal and asks the user for inputs to play the game.
It stores important data in text files.

[.NET](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/) is a reliable platform for many application types, I used it because it has many nice tools to use.
For my app I took advantage of the new programming style of console applications and the [IO](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/io/) library for interacting with files.

I didn't use any further technologies.

I came up with an idea of displaying the Rock Paper Scissors images, that was quite challenging because I had think of an own coordinate system to show the symbols, check out the game for more insight!
